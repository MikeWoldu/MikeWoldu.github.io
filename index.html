                <p class="indexP">
                
                    The purpose of this study is to collect data which will then be used to train multiple supervised machine learning algorithms in order to see how accurately the system would identify which punching technique was used, as a way of checking the form and/or technique of the user and ultimately create a smart IoT training solution.

                    <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                <p class="indexP">
                    
                    The focus of this thesis paper is divided into the two research questions that follow.
                    Research question 1: Is it possible to create a smart boxing training system, with accurate user movement recognition using Machine Learning to create an integrated IoT training solution?
                    How people use their bodies and how they perform varies greatly, as well as each oneâ€™s attributes (height, weight distribution, etc). This can be a lead factor in if the system will recognise the same type of punches correctly, if different people were to be recorded practising. We aim to see how accurate such a system would be, and if it could provide any useful information and knowledge to the user.
                    Research question 2: Is it possible to implement machine learning algorithms using a microprocessor or a mobile device in order to predict movement and respond in real time?
                    We know that microprocessors are very limited in terms of processing power and capabilities. As such, we would like to explore the possibility of implementing ML algorithms on one, if that would be possible and if not, if it would be able to handle transmitting information from multiple sensors simultaneously at a high frequency to an Android phone and let the phone handle the ML.

                    This thesis consists of both a literature study (theoretical part) and a practical experiment as well to answer our research questions. The literature study was conducted to find out whether ML algorithms can be carried out on a microcontroller as well as gather information on similar work by other researchers. The practical experiment was conducted to test our hypothesis on if punch types can be clearly identified using machine learning algorithms.

                    <h3>Literature study criteria</h3>
                <p class="indexP">
                    
                    For our literature study, the main sources that we used to obtain publications from, were Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library and Summon@HKR. Furthermore, Google was used for general-purpose searches like for example looking at the advantages and disadvantages of a specific ML algorithm. Below in Table 1 are some of the terms used for querying the digital libraries and Google. Results of the literature study are presented in Chapter 3 Related Work.
                    We performed searches using the same keywords on all databases. However, the keywords shown below in Table 1 are different for each publication database because they are the ones that we got the most relevant hits with.
                   
                </p>

                <h3>Data acquisition method</h3>
                
                <p class="indexP">
                
                    Below follows the methodology that was used for the practical study. The data collection was made possible by implementing an accelerometer and a gyroscope, which can be seen in Figure 1 below. The datasets were generated by the two Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) embedded into custom hardware of our design which was worn over the boxing glove at the wrist.
                    To gather the dataset, the device was strapped to the wrist of the user (see Figure 1), and then the user proceeded to throw each of the 6 punching techniques (see Figure 2) one at a time, while the sensors recorded all hand movement data.
                    Each punch type was performed 30 times, using a data sample rate of 300 Hz. When the desired number of repetitions was achieved, data transmission would stop, and the process would be repeated for the next type of punch. As soon as each session was stopped, all the data was uploaded to an online database for storing and retrieval for the ML algorithms to use. The device was placed on one hand at a time. Once all of the punches for the right hand were recorded (cross, right hook, right uppercut), the device was placed on the other hand to record the punches thrown by the left hand (jab, left hook, left uppercut). The punches were performed by a single amateur boxer in order to gather a uniform and consistent dataset in order to train the ML algorithms with.
                    Furthermore, before running the data values through the ML algorithms, in terms of pre-processing techniques applied, feature scaling was performed, which essentially normalizes the entire dataset, so each data point is proportionally far or close to the rest. This helped the algorithms produce more efficient results.

                    In section 5.1, results for the first research question are presented, concerning whether a punch type classification through Machine Learning is possible or not. Section 5.2 contains findings regarding the first part of the second research question, that is, if it would be possible to implement a machine learning algorithm on the microcontroller that was used. In section 5.3, results are presented about the second half of the second research question which concerns ML implementation on an Android phone.

                    <h3>ML classification</h3>
                <p class="indexP">
                    
                    The data collected from our sensors was put through the three chosen machine learning algorithms, KNN, Random Forest and 4 different kernels of SVM. Below are the results as can be seen in Table 2 & Table 3.
                   
                </p>

                <h3>Machine Learning implemented on our microcontroller</h3>
                
                <p class="indexP">
                
                    Regarding machine learning implemented using microcontrollers, study [23] was found that was done by Sakr et al. which suggests that it is possible, and the hardware specifications of the microcontroller they used to accomplish that were even listed. However, the way that they managed to implement the ML was by using a software called X-Cube-AI which is an AI expansion pack developed for specific boards produced by ST Electronics. So, with this evidence in mind, while their research could potentially serve as a guideline for us to implement the ML model on the ATMega328P microcontroller, in the end it was deemed not possible to use that software as it is not compatible with the microcontroller model that was used for this experiment.
                    While conducting some further investigation on the matter of machine learning on microcontrollers, we came across this article [24]. A team of researchers at Fraunhofer IMS have developed AIfES (Artificial Intelligence for Embedded Systems) which is a machine learning library programmed in C that can run on microcontrollers. One needs to keep in mind that it is still very limited as to what it can do due to the lack of processing power, but it still is a form of ML on microcontrollers. AIfES is not currently available to the public however, with the company only giving opportunities for manufacturers to license the software. Consequently, it would not be possible to use that software for this research either.
                    Lastly, there is also TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, which is a software that helps bring ML to IoT devices. It requires however a 32-bit platform and has been mainly tested using processors based on the Arm Cortex-M Series, while the chosen model for this research, the ATMega328P, is an 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR enhanced RISC architecture.

                <h3>Machine Learning implemented on an Android phone</h3>
                
                <p class="indexP">
                
                    Concerning the second half of our second research question, if the microcontroller would be able to handle transmitting data over Bluetooth to an Android phone and perform the Machine Learning on the phone, we found out that it is possible to do so, as we were able to successfully transmit data to an Android phone to collect the data to put through ML as shown above in section 5.1 as well as execute Machine Learning algorithms through an Android phone. For more information on how Machine Learning was implemented on Android see Appendix A.1.1. How results were outputted on Android can be seen in Figure 9 below. Here, KNN has been run and the classification report for it has been outputted.
